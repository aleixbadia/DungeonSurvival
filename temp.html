        <p>Oh, hello there and welcome to this dungeon! <br>
            In case you don't know already, let me explain you what is all this about.
            This is a Dungeon that never ends and you need tosurvive as many rounds
            as possible inside of it. During each round, new monsters will show up and
            you will have to defeat them all.
            
            Sorry, I forgot to ask, what's your name?</p>
